# [0.6.0](https://github.com/linkedin/opticss/compare/@opticss/code-style@0.5.0...@opticss/code-style@0.6.0) (2019-04-25)


### Features

* Replace prefer-whatever-to-any with prefer-unknown-to-any. ([c1bbadc](https://github.com/linkedin/opticss/commit/c1bbadc))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The lint rule prefer-whatever-to-any is no longer valid
because it relies on a type that was removed. The new
prefer-unknown-to-any lint rule should be used instead. An error is
raised if there's a configuration that enables the old rule.
