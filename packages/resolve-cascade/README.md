# `resolve-cascade`

Resolves a CSS Stylesheet against an HTML Document producing
a Cascade of selectors for each element. A Cascade can then
be used to produce a computed style for that element.

In addition to libraries for performing cascade resolution,
there's two assertions for help in writing tests that
check the expected effects of CSS on a document.
